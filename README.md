# Pokedex on React Native ⚛️

<hr />




## Task
<br>

The objective of this task is to find some design links to start a Pokemon app. Of course, it's not that easy and probably due to the lack of scope definition, the app can become quite messy and quickly. That's why it's important to have:

A design that includes the search screen.
A design that is not too simplistic to the point of being ugly.

### Ideas 💡
 Pokemon search system.
 Pokemon profile system.
 Pokemon favorites system.
 
### Goals 🚩
* To work on an asynchronous search system.
* To work on a routing system.
* To work on screens.
